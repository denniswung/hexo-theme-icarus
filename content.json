{"posts":[{"title":"Cyberpunk Theme Variant","text":"Icarus includes a new variant called Cyberpunk starting from version 3.0.0. The theme is inspired by the video game Cyberpunk 2077 developed by CD PROJEKT RED. This variant aims at providing a different Icarus experience to these who like dark-themed blogs. It should be noted that it uses recent web styling features that are not working correctlyin some legacy browsers, including Internet Explorer and legacy Microsoft Edge. To enable the Cyberpunk theme, open _config.icarus.yml and make the following change: _config.icarus.yml12- variant: default+ variant: cyberpunk You may also want to change the theme of highlighted code blocks. In that case, you can find some dark highlight.js themes here. Copy the file name, excluding the .css extension, and put it in the article.highlight.theme option in _config.icarus.yml. For example, if you want to change the theme to xt256, make the following change: _config.icarus.yml12345# Article related configurationsarticle: highlight:- theme: atom-one-light+ theme: xt256 Apart from the color palette, Icarus also used two image resources that are placed on the top navigation bar and bottom page footer from the official Cyberpunk 2077 website.

Icarus lets you pick among several built-in CDN provider options for serving third-party libraries and asset files used by Icarus. This article is also available in 简体中文. The following CDN functionalities are provided by ppoffice/hexo-component-inferno. Please refer to it for a complete list of supported providers and their configuration details. Built-in CDN providersCurrently, Icarus offers the following built-in CDN providers: CDNs for JavaScript Libraries cdnjs.com (cdnjs) jsDelivr (jsdelivr) UNPKG (unpkg) loli.net (loli) CDNs for Web Fonts Google Fonts (google) loli.net (loli) font.im (fontim) ustc.edu.cn (ustc) FontAwesome Font Icon CDNs FontAwesome 5 (fontawesome) loli.net (loli) The default CDN settings are: _config.icarus.yml1234providers: cdn: jsdelivr fontcdn: google iconcdn: fontawesome Custom CDN providersAdditionally, you can also custom CDN providers via URL templates. The template formats for each type of CDN provider are listed below: CDNs for JavaScript LibrariesCDN URL Template1https://some.cdn.domain.name/${package}/${version}/${filename} You need to replace the actual package name, version of the package, and relative file path with ${package}, ${version}, and ${filename} placeholders. For example, a JavaScript library with the following URL: UNPKG CDN URL Example1https://unpkg.com/d3@5.7.0/dist/d3.min.js can be generalized to this: UNPKG CDN URL Template1https://unpkg.com/${package}@${version}/${filename} Some CDN providers may adopt different URL schemes. For example, the moment.js library has the URL like this on CDN.js: CDN.js CDN URL Example1https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.22.2/moment.js while has the following URL on UNPKG: UNPKG CDN URL Example1https://unpkg.com/moment@2.22.2/min/moment.min.js Therefore, you should be aware of the URL format of your custom CDN provider. By default, Icarus will try to pass in the parameter using npm package name and relative file path (e.g., moment@2.22.2/min/moment.min.js). This npm scheme is used by jsDelivr and UNPKG. Otherwise, if you are using a CDN.js like provider, please prepend [cdnjs] to its URL template: CDN.js-style URL Template1[cdnjs]https://some.cdn.domain.name/${package}/${version}/${filename} CDNs for Web FontsYou can pass in the URL of a Google Font mirror or compatible webfont CDN. Icarus depends on the Ubuntu, Oxanium, and Source Code Pro fonts, so make sure your CDN provides those. The URL template should have two placeholders for font type (icon or font) and fontname: Webfont CDN URL Template1https://some.google.font.mirror/${type}?family=${fontname} FontAwesome Font Icon CDNsYou can pass in the URL to a custom FontAwesome CDN. No placeholders are required. The provided custom CDN should at lease have FontAwesome 5 icons as some of them are used in this theme. Icon Font CDN URL Template1https://custom.fontawesome.mirror/some.stylesheet.css All of the above should be put in the providers section of the theme configurations: _config.icarus.yml1234providers: cdn: 'https://some.cdn.domain.name/${package}/${version}/${filename}' fontcdn: 'https://some.google.font.mirror/${type}?family=${fontname}' iconcdn: 'https://custom.fontawesome.mirror/some.stylesheet.css' CDN helper functionsThree helper functions have been defined to help developers include third-party libraries easily with custom CDN support.

For example, to use &lt;your blog&gt;/source/gallery/image.jpg as a thumbnail image, you need to put thumbnail: /gallery/image.jpg in the front-matter. Read TimeYou can show a word counter and the estimated reading time of your article above the article title by setting readtime to true in the article section. _config.icarus.yml12article: readtime: true Update TimeTo show an update time of an article, set updated time in the article’s front-matter: post.md1234title: Getting Started with Icarusupdated: 2020-04-01 00:00:00---Post content... Then, set update_time to true in the article section of your theme configuration file: _config.icarus.yml12article: update_time: true You may also set update_time to false to hide update time for all articles, or auto to hide update time when it is the same as the article publication time. Article LicensingYou can show a section at the end of your posts/pages describing the licensing of your work. Both text and icons are accepted as license links. This configuration is the same as links in the navigation bar or the footer: _config.icarus.yml1234567article: # Article licensing block licenses: Creative Commons: icon: fab fa-creative-commons url: 'https://creativecommons.org/' 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0': 'https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/' SidebarTo make a sidebar fixed when you scroll the page, set the sticky setting of that sidebar to true in the sidebar section. _config.icarus.yml12345sidebar: left: sticky: false right: sticky: true Other ConfigurationsYou can refer to the Icarus User Guide to learn more about third-party plugins, widgets, and CDN provider configurations. Configuration Files and PriorityApart from the default theme configuration file _config.icarus.yml, Icarus also looks at the following locations for alternative configurations: The site configuration file at _config.yml Layout configuration files at _config.post.yml and _config.page.yml Post/page’s front-matter (Deprecated) Legacy theme configuration file at themes/icarus/_config.yml (Deprecated) Legacy layout configuration file at themes/icarus/_config.post.yml and themes/icarus/_config.page.yml Layout Configuration FilesLayout configuration files follow the same format and definitions as theme configuration files. The configurations in _config.post.yml apply to all posts, and those in _config.page.yml apply to all custom pages. They both override configurations in theme configuration files. For example, you can adopt a two-column layout for all posts in _config.post.yml: _config.post.yml12345678910widgets: - type: recent_posts position: left - type: categories position: left - type: tags position: left while keeping a three-column layout in all other pages: _config.icarus.yml12345678910widgets: - type: recent_posts position: left - type: categories position: right - type: tags position: right Post/Page Front-matterIf you wish to override theme configurations only for a certain post/page, you can set them in the front-matter of that post/page. For example, you can change the code block highlight theme of a single post by setting it in that post’s front-matter like the following: source/_post/some-post.md1234567title: My first postdate: '2015-01-01 00:00:01'article: highlight: theme: atom-one-dark---# Some Post The above setting will always override the article.highlight in _config.post.yml and _config.icarus.yml for that post. This layered configuration scheme is handy for differentiating page customizations and optimizations for different audiences. For instance, you can enable faster CDNs or a localized comment service based on the country and language of your page viewers. However, it should be noted that post or page attributes defined by Hexo will not override the theme configurations from the front-matter. Examples are title, date, updated, comments, layout, source, photos, and excerpt. Site Configuration FileAll configuration sources listed above, including theme configuration files, layout configuration files, and post/page front-matter, will override the site configuration file only for configurations used by Icarus. For instance, title in the _config.icarus.yml will override title in the _config.yml, but new_post_name will not since it is not used by Icarus. Also, the theme_config option in the site configuration file will merge with and override theme configurations from theme configuration files. However, using this option is highly discouraged. ConclusionIn conclusion, the scopes of the configuration sources and their priorities are: For a certain post or page Post/Page front-matter overrides all following sources. Layout configuration files override all following sources. theme_config option in the site configuration file overrides all following sources. Theme configuration files override all following sources. The site configuration file. For all posts or pages Layout configuration files override all following sources. theme_config option in the site configuration file overrides all following sources. Theme configuration files override all following sources. The site configuration file. For all posts, pages, and index pages theme_config option in the site configuration file overrides all following sources. Theme configuration files override all following sources. The site configuration file. Configuration Generation and ValidationAll Icarus theme configurations are written in YAML language. Icarus will automatically generate the default configuration file _config.icarus.yml from a set of JSON schemas if it does not exist. That’s why you don’t see an example configuration file (such as _config.yml.example) under the theme directory. Most of the JSON schemas are in the &lt;icarus_directory&gt;/include/schema directory, while the others are in the ppoffice/hexo-component-inferno repository. You can attach the --icarus-dont-generate-config flag to your hexo commands to prevent automatic configuration generation. The theme also validates your configurations against these schemas every time you execute a hexo command. If anything goes wrong during the validation, Icarus will print out the exact location of the misconfiguration and its error type. For example, the following messages tell us that the value of the logo setting should be either a string or an object, instead of an integer. You may skip the validation by appending the --icarus-dont-check-config flag to your hexo commands, but it is not recommended to do so. hexo log1234567891011121314INFO === Checking package dependencies ===INFO === Checking the configuration file ===WARN Configuration file failed one or more checks.WARN Icarus may still run, but you will encounter unexcepted results.WARN Here is some information for you to correct the configuration file.WARN [ { keyword: 'type', dataPath: '.logo', schemaPath: '#/properties/logo/type', params: { type: 'string,object' }, message: 'should be string,object' }] Additionally, Icarus will execute migration scripts to upgrade the default theme configuration file to the newest version if it is not. These scripts are in the &lt;icarus_directory&gt;/include/migration directory. You may disable the upgrade by appending the --icarus-dont-upgrade-config flag to your hexo commands. Finally, Icarus will also check the Node.js package dependencies and remind you to install them if you haven’t. Something wrong with this article? Click here to submit your revision.

If your question is not answered here, you can also refer to Icarus User Guide, Hexo documentation, and GitHub Issues. Additionally, you may find help from other Icarus users on GitHub Discussions. This article is also available in 简体中文. Site I can't generate my site. / I met some errors when I generate my site. Icarus 5 runs on Node.js 12.4.0 or a newer version. It also requires Hexo 6.0.0 or a newer version. Apart from that, make sure you have all the Node.js dependencies installed. You can find them in the dependencies section of the &lt;icarus_directory&gt;/package.json file. Also, remove all unused Node.js dependencies from your site, or they may cause strange problems to Icarus. How do I change the language of my site? Open the site configuration file _config.yml under the root directory. Change the following setting: _config.yml12- language: en+ language: &lt;language_name&gt; You can find all available translations under the &lt;icarus_directory&gt;/languages directory. The &lt;language_name&gt; is the translation file name without the .yml extension. Layout How do I change the page width? How do I use the one/two/three-column layout? To change the page width, edit the style file &lt;icarus_directory&gt;/include/style/responsive.styl. It defines the container width under different screen sizes. To change the width of the widgets or main content, edit &lt;icarus_directory&gt;/layout/common/widgets.jsx and &lt;icarus_directory&gt;/layout/layout.jsx. Find the CSS class names like is-12, is-8-tablet, and is-4-widescreen in these files. The number in the class names marks the number of columns a widget or main content takes. The screen size after the number, such as tablet and widescreen, refers to the condition when the column sizes take effect. Change the number in the class names such that the column count of main column and widget column(s) add up to 12 under the same screen size. For example, to have the main content column wider on widescreen, you can make the following changes: &lt;icarus_directory&gt;/layout/layout.jsx &gt;folded12345678 &lt;div class={classname({ column: true, 'order-2': true, 'column-main': true, 'is-12': columnCount === 1,- 'is-8-tablet is-8-desktop is-8-widescreen': columnCount === 2,+ 'is-8-tablet is-8-desktop is-9-widescreen': columnCount === 2, 'is-8-tablet is-8-desktop is-6-widescreen': columnCount === 3 &lt;icarus_directory&gt;/layout/common/widgets.jsx &gt;folded1234567 function getColumnSizeClass(columnCount) { switch (columnCount) { case 2:- return 'is-4-tablet is-4-desktop is-4-widescreen';+ return 'is-4-tablet is-4-desktop is-3-widescreen'; case 3: return 'is-4-tablet is-4-desktop is-3-widescreen'; You can refer to Bulma documentation for more details on the column system. Here are some tips for creating a one/two/three-column layout: You can remove all widgets from your theme configurations to create a one-column layout. You can move all your widgets to the same side of the page to create a two-column layout. You can place widgets on both sides of the page to create a three-column layout. To change the layout for a single or all posts/pages, refer to Configuration Files and Priority. Where are the layout files for widgets/comments/share...? How do I customize built-in widgets/comments/share...? The layout files for plugins and widgets have been moved to a separate Node.js package called hexo-component-inferno. This help theme developers better reuse common components across different themes and make overriding these components easy for average users. To customize these components, copy the layout files from the hexo-component-inferno repository and place them in the corresponding directories under &lt;icarus_directory&gt;/layout. For example, if you want to customize the Valine comment plugin, you can copy src/view/comment/valine.jsx from the hexo-component-inferno repository to &lt;icarus_directory&gt;/layout/comment/valine.jsx. Also, remember to fix Node.js imports like the following: &lt;icarus_directory&gt;/layout/comment/valine.jsx12- const { cacheComponent } = require('../../util/cache');+ const { cacheComponent } = require('hexo-component-inferno/lib/util/cache'); Finally, hexo clean your site before regenerating the HTML. Similarly, you can override static files like asset/js/insight.js in the same way. Why don't my layout changes take effect when I refresh the page (assuming I am running the hexo server? Icarus caches the layout files when you start the local Hexo server with the hexo server command. To make the layout changes take effect, restart the local server. Other times some intermediate data may be cached by Hexo in the memory or db.json database. Execute hexo clean before running hexo server or hexo generate should resolve this issue. Content My images are not showing up. / My images only show in index pages but not in posts. Make sure you use the absolute paths to your images. For example, your site is in a subdirectory of your domain name like https://ppoffice.github.io/hexo-theme-icarus and your image image.jpg under source/gallery/. You should include your image like this: /hexo-theme-icarus/gallery/image.jpg. You can also use Hexo’s {% img %} tag like the following to include an image automatically: 1{% img /gallery/image.jpg \"Image title\" %} In this case, you may omit the subdirectory from your image path. You can refer to Hexo documentation for more details. How to add an excerpt for a post? How to display the \"Read more\" button? Put a &lt;!-- more --&gt; tag in your post. Post content before this tag will be marked as an excerpt. Content after this tag will not show up on index pages. You can also specify a custom excerpt in the post’s front-matter. some-post.md12345title: Some Postdate: 2020-01-01excerpt: This is an article about ...---# Post content... How do I encrypt my posts? Use third-party Hexo plugins such as hexo-blog-encrypt. How do I use those fancy elements in this article for my posts? Refer to Bulma documentation for all available elements and styles. Copy the HTML snippets and put them in your Markdown files directly. Widgets and Plugins How can I get rid of those red alerts that are showing on the page and warning me of configuration value not set? Those alerts usually show up when you miss out on some plugin or widget configurations. If you don’t want to enable a certain plugin or widget, delete it or comment it out from your theme configurations. For example, you can disable the comment plugins by commenting out the following lines: _config.icarus.yml123456- comment:- type: disqus- shortname: + # comment:+ # type: disqus+ # shortname: Something wrong with this article?

你可以在&lt;icarus_directory&gt;/languages目录下找到所有可用的翻译。 &lt;语言名&gt;为不带后缀名的翻译文件名。 布局 我如何改变页面的宽度？我如何使用单栏/双栏/三栏布局？ 如要改变页面的宽度，编辑&lt;icarus_directory&gt;/include/style/responsive.styl这个样式文件。 此文件定义了不同屏幕尺寸下的页面容器宽度。 如要改变挂件或主内容宽度，编辑&lt;icarus_directory&gt;/layout/common/widgets.jsx和&lt;icarus_directory&gt;/layout/layout.jsx。 在这些文件中找到诸如is-12，is-8-tablet，和is-4-widescreen这样的CSS类名。 CSS类名中的数字标志着一个挂件或主内容所占据的栏数量。 数字后的屏幕尺寸，如tablet和widescreen，指代着栏数量生效的屏幕尺寸条件。 修改类名中的数字使主内容栏的栏数量和所有挂件栏的栏数量在相同屏幕尺寸下相加等于12。 例如，为使主内容栏在宽屏(widescreen)下更宽，你可以做出如下修改： &lt;icarus_directory&gt;/layout/layout.jsx &gt;folded12345678 &lt;div class={classname({ column: true, 'order-2': true, 'column-main': true, 'is-12': columnCount === 1,- 'is-8-tablet is-8-desktop is-8-widescreen': columnCount === 2,+ 'is-8-tablet is-8-desktop is-9-widescreen': columnCount === 2, 'is-8-tablet is-8-desktop is-6-widescreen': columnCount === 3 &lt;icarus_directory&gt;/layout/common/widgets.jsx &gt;folded1234567 function getColumnSizeClass(columnCount) { switch (columnCount) { case 2:- return 'is-4-tablet is-4-desktop is-4-widescreen';+ return 'is-4-tablet is-4-desktop is-3-widescreen'; case 3: return 'is-4-tablet is-4-desktop is-3-widescreen'; 你可以参考Bulma文档来获取更多关于布局系统的细节。 下面时一些创建单栏/双栏/三栏布局的提示： 你可以从主题配置中移除所有的挂件来创建单栏布局。 你可以将所有的挂件移动到页面的一侧来创建双栏布局。 你可以将挂件放在页面两边来创建三栏布局。 若要更改单个文章或页面的布局，请参考配置文件与优先级。 挂件/评论插件/分享按钮...的布局文件在哪里？我如何个性化内置的挂件/评论插件/分享按钮...？ 插件和挂件的布局文件已被移至一个单独的Node.js库中——hexo-component-inferno。 这样，主题开发者可以更好地在不同主题之间复用这些通用组件，并且普通用户可以更简便地覆盖这些内置组件。 若要自定义这些组件，从hexo-component-inferno仓库中拷贝布局文件并把它们放入&lt;icarus_directory&gt;/layout下的的相应目录中。 例如，如果你想要自定义Valine评论插件，你可以从hexo-component-inferno仓库中拷贝 src/view/comment/valine.jsx 到&lt;icarus_directory&gt;/layout/comment/valine.jsx。 同时像下面这样改正此文件头部的一些Node.js引用： &lt;icarus_directory&gt;/layout/comment/valine.jsx12- const { cacheComponent } = require('../../util/cache');+ const { cacheComponent } = require('hexo-component-inferno/lib/util/cache'); 最后，用hexo clean清理你的站点并重新生成HTML文件。 类似的，你可以用同样的方式覆盖主题内置的静态文件，如 asset/js/insight.js 。 为什么我的改变的布局文件在我刷新页面时没有生效（假设我正在使用hexo server）？ 当你使用hexo server启动本地Hexo服务器时，Icarus会缓存布局文件。 如要使布局文件的修改生效，请重启本地服务器。 其他情况下临时生成的数据会被Hexo缓存在内存或者db.json数据库中。 在运行hexo server或hexo generate之前执行hexo clean应该可以解决此问题。 内容 我的图片没有正确显示。 / 我的图片仅在首页显示，却无法在文章页面显示。 请确保你使用了图片的绝对路径。 例如，你的站点位于你域名的子目录下，如https://ppoffice.github.io/hexo-theme-icarus， 并且你的图片image.jpg放在了source/gallery/目录下。 那么你应该用/hexo-theme-icarus/gallery/image.jpg来引用你的图片。 你也可以像下面这样使用{% img %}这个Hexo标签来自动引用图片： 1{% img /gallery/image.jpg \"Image title\" %} 在这种情况下，你可以从图片路径中省略网站子目录。 你可以参考Hexo文档来了解更多详情。 如何为文章添加摘要？如何显示“阅读更多”按钮？ 在你的文章中添加&lt;!-- more --&gt;标签。 标签前面的文章内容会被标记为摘要，而其后的内容不会显示在文章列表上。 你也可以在文章的front-matter中设置自定义摘要。 some-post.md12345title: 一篇文章date: 2020-01-01excerpt: 这是一篇关于...---# 文章内容... 我如何加密文章？ 使用如hexo-blog-encrypt这样的第三方的Hexo插件。 我如何像这篇文章一样使用炫酷的页面元素？ 请参考Bulma文档来了解所有可选的元素和样式。 复制其中的HTML代码段并直接放入你的Markdown文件中。 挂件与插件 我如何才能移除页面上警告我一些配置值没有设置的红色警示信息？ 这些警示信息通常在你遗漏一些插件或挂件的配置设置时出现。 如果你不想开启某个插件或挂件，把它们从你的主题配置中删掉或注释掉。 例如，注释掉这几行来禁用掉评论插件： _config.icarus.yml123456- comment:- type: disqus- shortname: + # comment:+ # type: disqus+ # shortname: 文章内容有误？请点击此处提交修改。","link":"/hexo-theme-icarus/uncategorized/%E5%B8%B8%E8%A7%81%E9%97%AE%E9%A2%98/"},{"title":"Icarus快速上手","text":"欢迎使用Icarus！ Icarus是静态网站生成器Hexo的一款简单，精致，而现代的主题。 它力求设计上的优雅，但也不抛弃使用上的简单明了。 它灵活且多功能的配置系统让资深用户也能极尽细节地装饰他们的站点。 Icarus同时也提供了超多插件与挂件来满足你的多元的站点个性化和优化需求。 除此以外，它的崭新实现使得更好的IDE支持和第三方接入成为可能，并提供了更多未来的优化空间。 本文同时提供以下语言的翻译： English. 在你继续安装Icarus之前，请先花些时间阅览Hexo文档。 如要安装Icarus，你可以选择如下两种方式中的任意一种： 从源码安装 使用NPM安装 从GitHub的仓库中下载源码的压缩包并解压到你Hexo站点的主题目录中。 或者，你可以使用Git来克隆Icarus的代码仓库到themes目录下： Git Bash/命令行1git clone https://github.com/ppoffice/hexo-theme-icarus.git themes/icarus -b &lt;version number&gt;
